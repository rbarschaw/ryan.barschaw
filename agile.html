        <h2>The Situation</h2>
        <p>
          Partner Center's engineering organization had grown fast. What worked for a small team—informal coordination, ad-hoc planning, heroic individual efforts—was breaking down at scale.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Delivery was unpredictable.</strong> Leadership couldn't trust estimates. Teams couldn't trust each other's timelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependencies were invisible.</strong> Teams would discover blocking dependencies late, causing cascading delays.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality suffered.</strong> Rushing to meet deadlines meant cutting corners, which created more work later.</li>
          <li><strong>People burned out.</strong> The hero culture was exhausting. Good people left.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-title">The real problem</div>
          This wasn't a "process" problem—it was a trust and visibility problem. Leadership didn't trust teams to self-organize. Teams didn't trust each other to deliver. Everyone was working around the system instead of with it.
        </div>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I helped lead the adoption of Agile/SAFe practices across the organization. But the goal was never "do Agile"—it was "make delivery predictable and sustainable." We adapted the framework to fit us, not the other way around.
        </p>

        <h3>Started with the Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consistent sprint cadence</strong> across teams (2 weeks) so dependencies could be planned and handoffs were predictable</li>
          <li><strong>Sprint planning</strong> that actually resulted in achievable commitments—not wish lists that nobody believed</li>
          <li><strong>Retrospectives</strong> that led to real changes. Every retro ended with 1-2 specific action items, assigned to specific people, with deadlines.</li>
          <li><strong>Demo culture</strong> so progress was visible. Every sprint ended with a demo to stakeholders. No slides allowed—show working software.</li>
          <li><strong>Definition of Done</strong> that was explicit and enforced—code reviewed, tested, documented, deployable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Introduced PI Planning</h3>
        <p>
          PI (Program Increment) planning brought 100+ people together quarterly to plan the next 3 months. The format:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Day 1 morning:</strong> Business context and priorities from leadership</li>
          <li><strong>Day 1 afternoon:</strong> Team breakouts to draft plans</li>
          <li><strong>Day 1 end:</strong> First draft presentation of team plans</li>
          <li><strong>Day 2 morning:</strong> Dependency mapping across teams</li>
          <li><strong>Day 2 afternoon:</strong> Risk identification and mitigation planning</li>
          <li><strong>Day 2 end:</strong> Commitment to the plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the first time, dependencies were visible up front instead of discovered mid-sprint. Teams could see who was waiting on whom and plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few PI planning sessions were rough—people weren't used to this level of coordination. But within a few quarters, teams started to trust the process. The "surprise dependency" that derails a sprint became rare.
        </p>

        <h3>Made It Stick</h3>
        <p>
          The hardest part wasn't introducing practices—it was making them stick. Every transformation has a "trough of disillusionment" where people want to go back to the old way. I focused on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coaching teams through the awkward phases.</strong> Sitting in on standup, helping with estimation, facilitating hard conversations.</li>
          <li><strong>Protecting the process from leadership shortcuts.</strong> When executives wanted to skip retros or bypass planning for "urgent" work, I pushed back. The process only works if it's followed.</li>
          <li><strong>Celebrating wins visibly.</strong> When a team delivered a hard feature on time because of good planning, we made sure everyone knew. Success stories built momentum.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjusting based on feedback.</strong> If something wasn't working, we changed it. This isn't religion—it's about outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <div class="stats-grid">
          <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="value">100+</div>
            <div class="label">Engineers onboarded</div>

            <div class="label">Delivery predictability</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Delivery became predictable.</strong> Leadership could trust timelines. Teams could trust each other.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependencies were visible.</strong> Problems surfaced in planning, not in production.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality improved.</strong> Less rushing meant fewer production issues.</li>
          <li><strong>People were happier.</strong> Sustainable pace replaced hero culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I was recognized in the <strong>top 1% of the organization</strong> for driving execution and cross-team alignment. Not for a single launch, but for years of consistent, sustainable delivery.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Process is a tool, not a goal.</strong> The goal is predictable, sustainable delivery. Agile is one way to get there.</li>
          <li><strong>Transformation is cultural, not procedural.</strong> You can't just install Scrum. You have to change how people think about work.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect the process.</strong> Leadership will always have "urgent" reasons to skip retros or compress planning. Say no.</li>
          <li><strong>Celebrate small wins.</strong> Change is hard. People need to see progress to keep going.</li>
        </ul>
